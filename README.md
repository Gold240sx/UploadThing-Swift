- ‚úÖ **Two-Step Upload Flow** - Secure uploads via presigned S3 URLs
- ‚úÖ **File Key Generation** - Built-in Sqids-based key generation
- ‚úÖ **HMAC Signing** - Cryptographic signing with CryptoKit
- ‚úÖ **Type-safe** - Full Swift type safety with comprehensive error handling
- ‚úÖ **Async/Await** - Modern Swift concurrency support
- ‚úÖ **Cross-platform** - Works on macOS 13.0+, iOS 16.0+, tvOS 16.0+, watchOS 9.0+

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

Add UploadThingSwift to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/yourusername/UploadThingSwift.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

Or add it directly in Xcode:
1. File ‚Üí Add Package Dependencies
2. Enter the repository URL
3. Select version and add to your target

## Quick Start

### 1. Get Your Credentials

From [UploadThing Dashboard](https://uploadthing.com/dashboard):
- **Secret Key** (`sk_live_...`) - Your API key
- **App ID** - Your application identifier

### 2. Initialize the Client

```swift
import UploadThingSwift

let uploadThing = UploadThing(
    apiKey: "sk_live_your_secret_key",
    appId: "your-app-id",
    region: .usWest2  // optional, defaults to .usWest2
)
```

### 3. Upload Files

```swift
// Prepare your file
let fileData = try Data(contentsOf: fileURL)
let file = UTFile(
    name: "my-image.png",
    data: fileData,
    mimeType: "image/png"
)

// Upload (automatic two-step process: API ‚Üí S3)
let uploadedFiles = try await uploadThing.uploadFiles([file])

// Access your file
print("Uploaded to: \(uploadedFiles[0].url)")
// Example: https://utfs.io/f/abc123-def456.png
```

## How It Works

UploadThingSwift uses a **two-step upload flow** for maximum security and reliability:

1. **Request Permission**: SDK sends file metadata to UploadThing API
   - API validates your credentials
   - Returns presigned S3 URL with temporary access

2. **Upload to S3**: SDK uploads file to AWS S3
   - Uses presigned URL (no AWS credentials needed)
   - File is stored securely and made available via CDN

```
Your App ‚Üí UploadThing API ‚Üí Get Presigned URL
         ‚Üì
Your App ‚Üí AWS S3 ‚Üí Upload File
         ‚Üì
      Success! File available at utfs.io
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Regions

Choose the region closest to your users. Currently, all regions route through Frankfurt (fra1):

```swift
.usWest2        // US West - Default
.euWest1        // Europe (Frankfurt)
.apSoutheast1   // Asia Pacific
```

> **Note**: UploadThing currently uses a single ingestion endpoint (`fra1.ingest.uploadthing.com`) regardless of region setting. Region-specific endpoints may be added in the future.

### Content Disposition

Control how browsers handle the file:

```swift
.inline      // Display in browser (default)
.attachment  // Force download
```

### Access Control

Set file visibility:

```swift
.publicRead  // Anyone can access (default)
.private     // Only authenticated users can access
```

## API Reference

### `UploadThing`

Main client for interacting with UploadThing.

#### Methods

**`uploadFiles(_:customIds:contentDisposition:acl:) async throws -> [UTUploadedFile]`**

Uploads files using the REST API with automatic S3 upload.

Parameters:
- `files`: Array of `UTFile` objects to upload
- `customIds`: Optional custom identifiers for each file
- `contentDisposition`: How browsers should handle the file (`.inline` or `.attachment`)
- `acl`: Access control (`.publicRead` or `.private`)

Returns: Array of `UTUploadedFile` with public URLs

**`generatePresignedURLs(for:customIds:contentDisposition:acl:expiresIn:) async throws -> [UTPresignedURL]`**

Generates presigned URLs for client-side uploads (advanced use cases).

> **Note**: For most server-side Swift applications, use `uploadFiles()` instead.

### `UTFile`

Represents a file to upload.

```swift
UTFile(name: String, data: Data, mimeType: String?)
```

### `UTUploadedFile`

Information about an uploaded file.

```swift
struct UTUploadedFile {
    let key: String
    let name: String
    let size: Int
    let url: String
    let customId: String?
    let type: String
}
```

### `UTPresignedURL`

Presigned URL for client uploads.

```swift
struct UTPresignedURL {
    let url: URL           // Presigned URL for upload
    let fileKey: String    // Unique file identifier
    let publicURL: String  // Public URL after upload
}
```

## Error Handling

UploadThingSwift provides detailed error information:

```swift
do {
    let uploadedFiles = try await uploadThing.uploadFiles([file])
    print("Success! \(uploadedFiles.count) files uploaded")
} catch let error as UTError {
    switch error {
    case .invalidURL:
        print("‚ùå Invalid URL configuration")
    case .invalidAPIKey:
        print("‚ùå Invalid API key")
    case .uploadFailed(let message):
        print("‚ùå Upload failed: \(message)")
        // Example: "Upload failed (401): Invalid API key"
        // Example: "S3 upload failed"
    case .invalidFileKey:
        print("‚ùå Invalid file key generated")
    case .signatureGenerationFailed:
        print("‚ùå Could not generate HMAC signature")
    }
} catch {
    print("‚ùå Unexpected error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
}
```

### Common Error Scenarios

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `Invalid API key` | Wrong secret key | Check your `sk_live_...` key in dashboard |
| `Upload failed (400)` | Invalid request format | Ensure file data is valid |
| `Upload failed (401)` | Authentication failed | Verify API key and App ID |
| `S3 upload failed` | S3 upload rejected | Check file size limits |

## Examples

### Upload Multiple Files

```swift
let files = [
    UTFile(name: "doc1.pdf", data: pdf1Data, mimeType: "application/pdf"),
    UTFile(name: "doc2.pdf", data: pdf2Data, mimeType: "application/pdf"),
    UTFile(name: "image.png", data: imageData, mimeType: "image/png")
]

let uploadedFiles = try await uploadThing.uploadFiles(files)

for file in uploadedFiles {
    print("‚úÖ \(file.name) uploaded to: \(file.url)")
}
```

### Upload with Custom IDs

Track uploads with your own identifiers:

```swift
let avatarFile = UTFile(
    name: "avatar.jpg", 
    data: imageData, 
    mimeType: "image/jpeg"
)

let uploadedFiles = try await uploadThing.uploadFiles(
    [avatarFile],
    customIds: ["user-123-avatar"]
)

// Access via custom ID
print("User avatar URL: \(uploadedFiles[0].url)")
print("Custom ID: \(uploadedFiles[0].customId ?? "none")")
```

### Upload Images from macOS/iOS

```swift
#if os(macOS)
import AppKit

func uploadImage(_ image: NSImage) async throws -> String {
    guard let tiffData = image.tiffRepresentation,
          let bitmapImage = NSBitmapImageRep(data: tiffData),
          let pngData = bitmapImage.representation(using: .png, properties: [:]) else {
        throw NSError(domain: "ImageError", code: -1)
    }
    
    let file = UTFile(name: "image.png", data: pngData, mimeType: "image/png")
    let uploaded = try await uploadThing.uploadFiles([file])
    return uploaded[0].url
}
#else
import UIKit

func uploadImage(_ image: UIImage) async throws -> String {
    guard let imageData = image.pngData() else {
        throw NSError(domain: "ImageError", code: -1)
    }
    
    let file = UTFile(name: "image.png", data: imageData, mimeType: "image/png")
    let uploaded = try await uploadThing.uploadFiles([file])
    return uploaded[0].url
}
#endif
```

### SwiftUI Integration

```swift
import SwiftUI
import UploadThingSwift

struct FileUploadView: View {
    @State private var uploadStatus = "Ready"
    @State private var uploadedURL: String?
    
    let uploadThing = UploadThing(
        apiKey: "sk_live_...",
        appId: "your-app-id"
    )
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text(uploadStatus)
            
            if let url = uploadedURL {
                Link("View File", destination: URL(string: url)!)
            }
            
            Button("Upload File") {
                Task {
                    await uploadFile()
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    func uploadFile() async {
        uploadStatus = "Uploading..."
        
        do {
            let fileData = try Data(contentsOf: fileURL)
            let file = UTFile(name: "test.png", data: fileData, mimeType: "image/png")
            
            let uploaded = try await uploadThing.uploadFiles([file])
            uploadedURL = uploaded[0].url
            uploadStatus = "‚úÖ Upload complete!"
        } catch {
            uploadStatus = "‚ùå Upload failed: \(error.localizedDescription)"
        }
    }
}
```

## Testing

The package includes comprehensive unit tests:

```bash
cd UploadThingSwift
swift test
```

Tests cover:
- ‚úÖ File key generation (Sqids)
- ‚úÖ HMAC signature generation
- ‚úÖ Client initialization
- ‚úÖ URL construction
- ‚úÖ Error handling

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid API key" Error

```swift
// ‚ùå Wrong - using token instead of secret key
let uploadThing = UploadThing(
    apiKey: "eyJhcGlLZXkiOi...",  // This is a TOKEN
    appId: "MyApp"
)

// ‚úÖ Correct - using secret key
let uploadThing = UploadThing(
    apiKey: "sk_live_13ebd79...",  // This is the SECRET KEY
    appId: "MyApp"
)
```

### Files Not Uploading

1. **Check credentials**: Verify your `sk_live_...` key and App ID
2. **Check file size**: UploadThing has file size limits per plan
3. **Check mime type**: Ensure you're providing the correct mime type
4. **Enable debug logging**: Add print statements to see detailed flow

```swift
do {
    print("üì§ Starting upload...")
    let result = try await uploadThing.uploadFiles([file])
    print("‚úÖ Success: \(result[0].url)")
} catch {
    print("‚ùå Error: \(error)")
}
```

### Network Issues

If you see "server with the specified hostname could not be found":

1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify DNS resolution: `nslookup fra1.ingest.uploadthing.com`
3. Check firewall/proxy settings
4. UploadThing API may be experiencing downtime (check status page)

## Requirements

- macOS 13.0+ / iOS 16.0+ / tvOS 16.0+ / watchOS 9.0+
- Swift 5.9+
- Xcode 15.0+ (for development)

## Performance

- **Upload Speed**: Limited by your network and UploadThing's infrastructure
- **File Key Generation**: ~0.001ms per file (Sqids algorithm)
- **HMAC Signing**: ~0.005ms per signature (CryptoKit)
